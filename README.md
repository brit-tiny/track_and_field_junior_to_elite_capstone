From Junior to Elite: Pushing the Bar in Track and Field Jumps and Where the Bar Might Go

The path from youth athetics to the elite stage is a compelling story of growth, performance, and progression. While in many decades, most sports have undergone significant transformations due to rule modifications and/or advances in technology. For example, swimming has seen the introduction of wave reducing lane dividers, and performance enhancing swimsuits resulting in faster times. In track and field, the jumps (long jump, triple jump, and high jump) have seen a slower evolution maintaning their foundation in technique rather than technological or rule changes. These events remain uniquely athletic and technical, requiring a delicate balance of speed, strength, and precise movements. The high jump has seen minimal change since Dick Fosbury revolutionized the event with the introduction of the Fosbury Flop in 1963. 

Overview
This project aims to analyze top performance in long jump, triple jump, and high jump from U18 to senior (professional) level and build trajectory style projections. These projections would be based on an athletes current age, performance history, and estimate a target age for top performance with a low, average, and high projection bands.





Missing Elevation Data

Venue elevation was included where city level data was publicly available. Many venues were only listed by name and country lacking any precise information for geolocation, thus resulting in a null elevation. I chose this approach to keep my dataset's integrity while not forcing a false narrative.
