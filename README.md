From Junior to Elite: Pushing the Bar in Track and Field Jumps and Where the Bar Might Go

The path from youth athetics to the elite stage is a compelling story of growth, performance, and progression. While in many decades, most sports have undergone significant transformations due to rule modifications and/or advances in technology. For example, swimming has seen the introduction of wave reducing lane dividers, and performance enhancing swimsuits resulting in faster times. In track and field, the jumps (long jump, triple jump, and high jump) have seen a slower evolution maintaning their foundation in technique rather than technological or rule changes. These events remain uniquely athletic and technical, requiring a delicate balance of speed, strength, and precise movements. The high jump has seen mimimal change since Dick Fosbury revolutionized the event with the introduction of the Fosbury Flop in 1963. 

My experience as a Division 1 track and field jumper has shown me that despite generational shifts core elements have remained consistant. From my Uncle's world record long jump in 1960 to today's Olympic gold medalist Tara Davis Woodhall, the similarities highlight how foundational techniques endure over time even as training methode evolve. Motivated by these subtile changes I want to explore the rate of performance progression from junior to elite jumpers to see if there is any patterns that may predict perfomance outcomes in the next Olympic games.
